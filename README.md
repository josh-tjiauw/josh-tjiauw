<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>:pencil2: My developer journey started from a young age. Browsing through the internet and playing videogames throughout my childhood, I can't help but wonder how other developers implement these UI components and functionality that millions of users use daily. Thus, I decided to delve deeper in learning and understanding how computers worked.</h3>
<h3>:muscle: What keeps me going in development is the feeling of accomplishment after finishing that problem or project that I have worked on for countless hours!</h3>
